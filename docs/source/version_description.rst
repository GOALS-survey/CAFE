v1.0 (2023/12/XX)

The current release of ``CAFE`` supports the extraction and fitting of any single spectrum extracted from any combination (or all) of the MIRI/MRS sub-band cubes (ch1_short, ch1_medium, ch1_long, ch2_short, ch2_medium, ch2_long, ch3_short, ch3_medium, ch3_long, ch4_short, ch4_medium, ch4_long), covering the wavelength range from ~5 to 28Î¼m. NIRSpec/IFU spectral extractions and fitting will be supported soon in subsequent releases. Nevertheless, we note that ``CAFE`` already includes some of these capabilities, but they have not been fully tested and therefore are not documented here. The users, however, should feel free to experiment with them if they wish, but no support will be provided.
