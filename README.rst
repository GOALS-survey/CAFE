CAFE
====

``CAFE`` is a revamped version of the CAFE software –originally developed for fitting Spitzer/IRS spectra– that has been updated and optimized to work with the new JWST IFU data. The new CAFE is composed of two main tools: (1) the CAFE Region Extraction Tool Automaton (CRETA) and (2) the CAFE the spectral fitting tool. CRETA performs single-position and full-grid extractions from JWST IFU datasets; that is, from pipeline-processed cubes obtained with the NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS instruments. The CAFE fitter uses the spectra extracted by CRETA (or spectra provided by the user) and performs a spectral decomposition of the continuum emission (stellar and/or dust), as well as of a variety of common spectral features (in emission and absorption) present in the near- and mid-IR spectra of galaxies. The full dust treatment (size and composition) performed by CAFE (see Marshall et al. 2007) allows the dust continuum model components to fit not only spectra typical of normal star-forming galaxies but also complex spectral profiles seen in more extreme, heavily dust-obscured starburst galaxies, such as luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), active galactic nuclei (AGN), or very luminous quasars.
